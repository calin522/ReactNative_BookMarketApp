# ReactNative_BookMarketApp
I pushed this code directly here, almost 3 years ago, just to be on a Github Branch and to be public. Initially, when I started this App, I worked on a private instance on BitBucket.
I know the code is not the best (at least, it did his job. The app is pretty nice, to be honest) :) (I have an API Key in my files etc.). The Database Instance was already finished then and outdated (nice excuse xD).
Enjoy! <3
